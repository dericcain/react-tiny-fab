> A tiny (~700 byte gzip) WAI-ARIA compliant Floating Action Button for React

> `react-tiny-fab` v3 now relies on React version 16.8 and up because it is implemented using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

Want to use a Floating Action Button without having to import the whole Material Design Components library? Weighing in
at only around 671 bytes gzipped, React Tiny FAB is a great solution. It is a lightweight, fast, and flexible component.
